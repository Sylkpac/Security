# Building a Secure and Scalable AWS VPC: A Thought Process Guide<a name="buildingvpc"></a> 

When stepping into AWS networking, the choices can be overwhelming. But at its core, designing a secure and functional Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is all about planning your resources wisely and keeping security top of mind. Whether you're aiming to be a Cloud Engineer or a Security Engineer, understanding the logic behind these decisions is crucial. Let’s break it down in a way that actually makes sense.

## Understanding the Big Picture

Before touching AWS, take a step back and ask: What are we trying to achieve? At a high level, we need a secure network with controlled internet access, isolated resources, and smooth internal communication.

### Here’s what we’re building:

- A VPC 
- Public and private subnets
- Internet access for some resources, but not all
- Secure routing to control who talks to whom
- Network traffic management 

## Step 1: Planning the VPC Layout

AWS lets you define a CIDR block (a range of IPs) for your VPC. A common choice is `10.0.0.0/16`, which gives us plenty of room for subnets. Learn more on this topic here:

[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html)

Think of subnets as different rooms in your house. Some rooms (public subnets) have windows (internet access), while others (private subnets) don’t.

### We’ll divide our VPC into:

- **Public Subnets** (2 total, across different availability zones)  
  - These host resources that need internet access, like a NAT Gateway.

- **Private App Subnets** (2 total, across different availability zones) 
  - Where application servers live, safely away from direct internet exposure.

- **Private Database Subnets** (2 total, across different availability zones) 
  - Where our databases sit, even more locked down than the app servers.

### Subnet CIDR Blocks Example:

- Public Subnet 1 (AZ1) – `10.0.1.0/24`
- Public Subnet 2 (AZ2) – `10.0.2.0/24`
- Private App Subnet 1 (AZ1) – `10.0.3.0/24`
- Private App Subnet 2 (AZ2) – `10.0.4.0/24`
- Private DB Subnet 1 (AZ1) – `10.0.5.0/24`
- Private DB Subnet 2 (AZ2) – `10.0.6.0/24`

**Takeaway for a Cloud Engineer:** You need this structured setup to ensure high availability, disaster recovery, and scalability.

**Takeaway for a Security Engineer:** Proper segmentation is essential to prevent security breaches. Databases should never be directly exposed to the internet.

## Step 2: Setting Up Internet Access (Wisely!)

Not everything should have unrestricted internet access. Here’s how it should be handled:

- **Public Subnets:** Attach an Internet Gateway so public resources can send and receive internet traffic. 

- **Private Subnets:** Use a NAT Gateway to allow outbound connections (for updates, logs, etc.) but block inbound internet traffic.

### Route Table Logic:

- Public subnets: `0.0.0.0/0` sends data to the Internet Gateway
- Private subnets: `0.0.0.0/0` sends data to the NAT Gateway (so they can access updates, but remain shielded)

*The `0.0.0.0/0` in route tables represents all IPv4 addresses—essentially, it is a catch-all for destinations not covered by more specific rules. Which means "anywhere on the internet."*

**Takeaway for a Cloud Engineer:** NAT Gateways allow instances to reach the internet securely, without exposing them to inbound traffic.

**Takeaway for a Security Engineer:** Any direct internet exposure is a risk. By keeping databases and internal services in private subnets, you reduce attack surfaces.

## Step 3: Security First – Access Control & Monitoring

Security is a layered approach, and in AWS, we have a few key tools:

- **Security Groups (SGs):** Act as instance-level virtual firewalls, controlling inbound and outbound traffic for individual resources.
  - Web servers allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic from the internet.
  - Databases only allow connections from application servers.

- **Network ACLs (NACLs):** These are broader rules at the subnet level. Good for enforcing strict restrictions but less flexible than Security Groups.

- **VPC Flow Logs:** These logs capture network traffic and help monitor suspicious behavior.

**Takeaway for a Cloud Engineer:** Security Groups are stateful, meaning return traffic is automatically allowed. NACLs are stateless, meaning you must manually allow return traffic.

**Takeaway for a Security Engineer:** Logging and monitoring are critical for detecting unauthorized access attempts. Always enable VPC Flow Logs.

## Step 4: Document Everything!

Before wrapping up, document your design so others can understand your setup. This includes:

- Architecture diagrams
- Explanation of subnetting and routing choices
- Security considerations

Cloud and security teams work together to ensure a scalable, secure, and well-documented environment. The goal isn’t just to build, it’s to build something that’s easy to manage, audit, and improve.
